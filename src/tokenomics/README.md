# Tokenomics

---

- 1 new DOGMONEY is created per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://app.dogmoney.money/farm>. The first two weeks of launch will have a 10x bonus.

- 10% of all newly created DOGMONEY is minted to dev wallet.

- 0.05% of the exchange fees are awarded to holders of the xDOGMONEY token.


#### What is the cap of the $DOGMONEY token?

There is no hard cap of DOGMONEY

#### Does the $DOGMONEY token have any burn?

No.

#### Are there future usecases for DOGMONEY

Yes. xDOGMONEY will be the only way to buy yield bearing NFTs which allow for themed governance. Additional protocols which are built with DogMoney dev rewards will also send portion of fees to xDOGMONEY holders.

We also hope to launch a DOGMONEY credit card which will allow you to spend DOGE, wDOGE, and DOGMONEY anywhere IRL. The card would allow for a portion of the cash-back rewards to automatically be applied to charity on sale, so you can help the world every time you buy something with DOGMONEY.
