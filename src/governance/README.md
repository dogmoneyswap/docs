## DogMoney Governance

DogMoney aims to be a community-led decentralized effort to bring the maximum utility to DogeChain and grow the ecosystem. To achieve this, investors in DogeChain have a say in upgrading and expanding the protocols and products we launch. Currently DogeChain is still relatively centralized in it's governance, but we are working towards gradually moving ownership over to a DAO.
