## What is xDOGMONEY?

xDOGMONEY is a token, similar to our DLP tokens, that you receive in exchange for staking DOGMONEY tokens in the DOGMONEYBowl. While holding the token, it will appreciate in value, as fees from our exchange platform are "served to the DOGMONEYBowl." The xDOGMONEY token is always worth more than a regular DOGMONEY token, because xDOGMONEY accrues value from platform fees. When users make trades on the DogMoney exchange a 0.3% fee is charged. 0.05% of this fee is added to the DOGMONEYBowl pool in the form of LP tokens. When the rewards contract is called (minimum once per day) all the LP tokens are sold for DOGMONEY (on DogMoney Exchange). The newly purchased DOGMONEY is then divided up proportionally between all of the xDOGMONEY holders in the pool, meaning their xDOGMONEY is now worth more DOGMONEY. Because of the way the rewards are generated, the price of xDOGMONEY will increase with the value of DOGMONEY, and the value of one xDOGMONEY will always be greater than the value of one DOGMONEY. Fees generated into the DOGMONEYBowl are vested for a period of time [see the Vesting FAQ].
