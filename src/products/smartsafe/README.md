## What is Smart Safe?

Smart Safe allows anyone to create a highly secure and easy to use multisig (multiple signature) wallet on DogeChain, with built in support for interacting with [LNS](https://app.bch.domains) and [DogMoney](https://app.dogmoney.money). Smart Safe also functions as a ERC-20 & ERC-721 wallet, with the ability to show token icons and price in USD of your assets, and display your NFTs.

Smart Safe is a fork of [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), so it is easy for other DogeChain applications to [add support to their dApps](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/build-with-safe/sdks/safe-apps/get-started). We have not changed any of the contract code, you can verify that contracts are deployed to the same addresses as on other chains, so you can be assured that Smart Safe is well tested for large amounts of capital.

## DogMoney App

Full support for DogMoney exists out of the box. You and your team or project can now swap, provide liquidity, and enter in to yield farms using the Smart Safe multisig wallet. This allows for much greater decentralization of projects, and eliminates the issue of one keyholder being a central source of failure.

### DogMoney Integration

Your liquidity, farms, and staked DOGMONEY are easily auditable and visible in the Assets tab.

## LNS App

In addition, full support for LNS exists out of the box. Businesses, DAOs, and decentralized applications can register and transfer names, as well as set address and text records using Smart Safe. This may be particularly helpful for teams which wish to keep their treasury addresses up to date securely.


## Utility Apps
We also provide additional built-in utility apps that seek to make DogeChain easier to use for projects.

* CSV airdrops of ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, and wDOGE.
* Batched Transactions
* WalletConnect
